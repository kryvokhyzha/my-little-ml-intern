# 004 — Budget and gates

<!-- What budget.md is, what every gate enforces, and how to react when a gate says no.
Companion to docs/001-architecture.md (the contract) and docs/003-experiment-lifecycle.md
(the contract in motion). -->

## Philosophy: caps are accounting documents, not vibes

A budget is the spend you negotiated _before_ the run, written down where a
program can enforce it. Every gate decision is a nonzero-exit-code refusal with
a printed reason — never a judgment call made mid-run when sunk cost is
whispering "one more retry".

Caps cut both ways:

- **Ceiling:** no new path or retry launches past a cap. "Just one quick run" is
  how budgets die.
- **Floor:** caps never license quitting work that is already budgeted. Hitting
  `max_paths` doesn't excuse a missing postmortem, a ledger row left `running`,
  or skipping verify on a finished run. Under-spend is not a goal either —
  budgeted paths exist to be run.

## budget.md anatomy

Each experiment carries its own
[budget.md](../experiments/001-tiny-sft-smoke/budget.md), scaffolded from a
budget config group and parsed by `intern.budget`:

```text
# Budget

max_paths: 2
max_retries_per_path: 2
compute_cap_gpu_h: 2.0
scale_ceiling_params: 200000000
token_budget: null

## Spent

paths_launched: 0
retries_used: 0
gpu_h_used: 0.0
```

- `max_paths` — how many distinct solution paths (plan.md hypotheses) may be
  launched. `can-launch` denies when `paths_launched` reaches it.
- `max_retries_per_path` — retries are counted over the whole retry **tree**,
  not per link of a chain. A chain path-1 → path-2 → path-3 has _two_ retries
  charged against path-1's tree; renaming a retry does not reset the counter. On
  top of that sits a **global backstop**: any retry is denied once
  `retries_used ≥ max_paths × max_retries_per_path`, no matter how the trees are
  shaped.
- `compute_cap_gpu_h` — hard GPU-hour ceiling, checked by both `can-launch` and
  `can-retry` once `gpu_h_used` reaches it.
- `scale_ceiling_params` — model-size ceiling, enforced only when you pass
  `--params` to `can-launch` (so pass it whenever the path has a parameter
  target).
- `token_budget` — advisory for the orchestrating agent (LLM-token spend), not
  machine-enforced; `null` is fine.

## The spent tally — who updates it

The `## Spent` section is updated **only** by the CLI:

```bash
uv run python scripts/python/intern.py budget --experiment NNN record-launch
uv run python scripts/python/intern.py budget --experiment NNN record-retry
uv run python scripts/python/intern.py budget --experiment NNN record-gpu-h --hours 0.5
```

Never by hand. The tally is the audit trail — its whole value is that every
number in it corresponds to a `record-*` call at a known point in the lifecycle.
001's tally showing `retries_used: 5` against a 2×2 backstop is an honest record
of a supervised pipeline shakedown outrunning its defaults; a hand-edited tally
can show anything, which is to say nothing.

## Gate commands and exit codes

Everywhere: **0 = ok/allowed, 1 = gate failed/denied, 2 = usage error or missing
artifacts.** These exits are the blocking mechanism — skills must stop on
nonzero.

```bash
uv run python scripts/python/intern.py budget --experiment NNN status
uv run python scripts/python/intern.py budget --experiment NNN can-launch [--params N]
uv run python scripts/python/intern.py budget --experiment NNN can-retry --path-id path-1
uv run python scripts/python/intern.py budget --experiment NNN record-launch|record-retry
uv run python scripts/python/intern.py budget --experiment NNN record-gpu-h --hours H
uv run python scripts/python/intern.py verify --experiment NNN [--vocab-size N] [--checks a,b]
uv run python scripts/python/intern.py ledger --experiment NNN show|upsert --path-id ... [--field value ...]
uv run python scripts/python/intern.py status --experiment NNN [--json]
uv run python scripts/python/intern.py publish --experiment NNN [--repo-id org/name] [--private true|false]
uv run python scripts/python/intern.py deps [--min-age-days 7]
```

## The verify gate

`verify` runs eight checks against the experiment's artifacts and writes
[verify.md](../experiments/001-tiny-sft-smoke/verify.md) (`VERDICT:` line per
check, `OVERALL:` line at the end). One line each:

| #   | check               | FAIL when                                                                                                                          |

| 2   | `eval_train_gap`    | \|final eval loss − final train loss\| ≥ 0.5 (eval = `loss(split=eval)`, `eval_loss`, or `val_loss`)                               |

| 4   | `stderr_scan`       | `Traceback` / `RuntimeError` / `CUDA out of memory` in logs/stderr.log (warnings listed but PASS)                                  |

| 8   | `kl_ref`            | (auto when KL metrics present) mean KL non-finite or ≤ 0                                                                           |

Checks SKIP when their inputs are absent (unless stated otherwise) — 001's
report is `PASS (5 passed, 0 failed, 3 skipped)` because no eval split and no
DPO metrics existed.

**Task-awareness.** Checks read the `task` meta from metrics.jsonl.
`loss_plausibility` applies to LM tasks only (`trl_sft` and unknown count as
LM); it SKIPs for `trl_dpo` and `lightning`, whose losses are not vocab
cross-entropy. `reward_margin` and `kl_ref` switch on automatically when DPO
metrics are present.

**run_start scoping.** metrics.jsonl accumulates across paths and retries; every
check is scoped to records at or after the _last_ `run_start` event (whole file
when none exists). That is why you never delete metrics.jsonl between retries —
see [003-experiment-lifecycle.md](003-experiment-lifecycle.md) §5. A `run_start`
with no metric records after it is a crashed pipeline → exit 2, not "done".

**The red-flag rule.** Final train loss < 1.0 on an LM task FAILs even when the
vocab size is unknown. A "too good" loss means data leakage, a broken loss, or
NaN collapse reported as 0.0 (001's path-2) far more often than it means a great
model. Waiving it is an explicit human decision, never a default.

**Scoping/waiving via `--checks`.** `--checks a,b` re-runs only the named checks
— useful to confirm a single fixed check without re-litigating the rest. A
scoped run only _prints_ its report; it never writes or overwrites verify.md.
Only a full (unscoped) run writes verify.md, so the on-disk verdict always
reflects the complete gate — you cannot launder a pass by cherry-picking checks.
And mechanical PASS is necessary, not sufficient: the human `JUDGMENT:` line on
the generation samples is mandatory before any success claim.

## Ledger semantics

[ledger.md](../experiments/001-tiny-sft-smoke/ledger.md) is a markdown table
managed by `intern.ledger` — one row per path, columns exactly:

```text
| path_id | approach | status | final_train_loss | final_eval_loss | verify | failure_cause | retry_of | gpu_min | run_url |
```

- `status ∈ queued|running|passed|failed|dropped`;
  `verify ∈ pass|fail|pending|n/a`. Unknown columns and invalid enum values are
  rejected by `upsert` (exit 2).
- `retry_of` records lineage: path-2 with `retry_of: path-1` is a node in
  path-1's retry tree, and it is that whole tree the budget gate counts. 001's
  ledger is a six-row single tree — read it top to bottom and you get the entire
  retry story with one `failure_cause` per row.
- No row may be left `running` when the experiment ends; a path that finished
  but failed verify is `failed`/`fail` with a `failure_cause`, not deleted.

## Budget group variants

Experiment configs compose a budget group; `new-experiment` copies the group's
values into the experiment's budget.md at scaffold time (budget.md is the
enforced artifact from then on).

- [configs/budget/default.yaml](../configs/budget/default.yaml) — 2 paths, 2
  retries per path, 2.0 GPU-h, 200M-param ceiling. Sized for a single-hypothesis
  experiment with a plan-B.
- [configs/budget/autoresearch.yaml](../configs/budget/autoresearch.yaml) — 10
  paths, 1 retry per path, 8.0 GPU-h, same param ceiling. Sized for the
  autoresearch loop's generational sweeps: many cheap hypotheses, little
  patience per hypothesis. Compose with `budget: autoresearch` in the experiment
  config.

Pick the group at scaffold time; changing budgets mid-experiment is a cap edit
(see FAQ), not a group swap.

## FAQ

**The gate denied me — now what?** Read the printed reason; it names the cap and
the numbers (`denied: retries_used 4 >= global retry cap 4 ...`). A denial is an
answer, not an obstacle: do not re-run the command hoping for drift (doom-loop
guard), do not launch anyway. Interactive → present the situation to the human,
who may raise the cap (below). Headless → write the postmortem, fire
`scripts/bash/notify.sh approval_required "<cap hit + what you'd do with more>"`,
and stop that path. If every path is exhausted, that's `notify.sh error` — the
experiment ends with results honestly reported as not achieved, never
`train_done`.

**Can I edit budget.md by hand?** Caps: yes — before the run they gate, as a
deliberate human decision (raising `max_retries_per_path` because retries so far
were pipeline bugs, not method failures, is a legitimate call — 001 effectively
lived this). Spent: **never**. The `## Spent` lines are written only by
`record-launch` / `record-retry` / `record-gpu-h`; a hand-edited tally destroys
the audit trail the whole gate rests on.

**What does exit 2 mean?** "You asked the question wrong, or the artifacts
aren't there" — wrong experiment number, missing budget.md/ledger.md, a
malformed file, a missing required flag, or (for `verify`) a run that never
logged metrics. It is neither a pass nor a denial: fix the invocation or the
pipeline and ask again. In particular, never hand-craft the missing artifact (an
empty metrics.jsonl, a fabricated ledger row) to convert a 2 into a 0 — exit 2
on `verify` specifically means training itself is broken.
